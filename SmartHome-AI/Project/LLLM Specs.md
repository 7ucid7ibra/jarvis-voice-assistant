Currently when I run it locally on my Mac or my Windows laptop, CPU is the most important. But that will be different on real hardware that was optimized for this purpose. I still need to do more [[Research]] on what means what, and the whole quantization and parameters of LLMs.

**AI ADVICE:** Parameters: Model size (e.g., 7B = 7 billion weights); higher = smarter but slower. Quantization: Reduces precision (e.g., FP16 to INT4) for faster inference on CPUs/GPUs, trading accuracy. On optimized hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi with accelerators), focus on latency <1s for responses. Research tools like Ollama or llama.cpp for local setup.

human response: So basically, 7 billion weights kind of means 7 billion connections, neurons, or whatever. So the more there are, the smarter it is, but the more time it also needs to think, or on the other hand, more power. Does it mean, for example, if I run a 1 billion weights model on a slow computer, and then on a fast one, will it always be faster, or will the weights still make it slow even though the computer has enough power? You were talking about quantization. I'm guessing that is kind of like summarizing a large context of information, so like that the model can learn more, but since it compressed some information, the data is not as accurate anymore. is that correct? What is FP16 and INT4 and what does FASTA inference mean or the word inference in general? What do you mean a Raspberry Pi with accelerators? Basically when I have more processing power connected? You mentioned optimized hardware, so I'm guessing the rule per thumb, more GPU power, the better, is not necessarily true. But there are other things about the hardware that can make it better for a use case, like a local language model right?

**AI ADVICE:** Yes, weights are like connections in a neural network; more = potentially smarter but slower/heavier. A 1B model on a fast computer will run faster than on a slow one, but a large model (e.g., 13B) will always be slower than a small one (1B) on the same hardware due to computational load. Quantization compresses the model's weights (not context) to reduce size/speed, trading minor accuracy—it's like using fewer bits per weight. FP16: 16-bit floating-point (standard precision); INT4: 4-bit integer (low precision for efficiency). Inference: Generating output from the model (e.g., text prediction); "faster inference" means quicker response times. Raspberry Pi with accelerators: Pi plus add-ons like Coral TPU or GPU hats for AI tasks. Optimized hardware: Specialized chips (e.g., Apple M2 Neural Engine, NVIDIA GPUs) excel over generic high-end CPUs due to efficient matrix ops for LLMs.
