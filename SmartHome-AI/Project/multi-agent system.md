the user input will be first analyzed by one agent that will decide the intent of the user, and then pass on information to the next appropriate agent that will either do an action like turn off a switch or retain memory about something the user said. Or just give a straight reply. After doing the action, that agent sends on information to the next one, so it can respond. Same thing with the memory agent.
