I don't have very much experience coding any kind of screen or animation. My first experience with that was not long ago on the ESP32-B3-LORA boards with a small screen on them. And I was able to create some animations using AI. Flash the board and it worked. But these new screens are of higher quality and I have to figure out how this works.

**AI ADVICE:** ESP32 screens (e.g., TFT LCDs like ILI9341) offer higher resolution/color than basic OLEDs. Use libraries like TFT_eSPI (for SPI displays) or Adafruit_GFX (universal). For animations, leverage Arduino IDE with ESP32; create frames in loops, use millis() for timing. Connect via SPI/I2C; power from ESP32's 3.3V. Start with examples from GitHub repos; for smart home, display status (e.g., appliance states) or simple GUIs.
