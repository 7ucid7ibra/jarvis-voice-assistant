The little bit that I know is that matter is a sort of language for communication protocol for smart home appliances, maybe also other things, and apparently it's supposed to become a new standard, or supposedly it should be integrated into many things in the future, and that it has something to do with [[Thread]]. I think maybe that is the communication protocol, I'm not quite sure, but it's connected to it. [[Research]]

**AI ADVICE:** Matter is an open-standard protocol for secure, interoperable smart home devices (e.g., bulbs, locks) over IP networks. It unifies ecosystems (Google, Apple, etc.) and integrates with Thread for low-power mesh networking. Use ZBT-2 for Matter/Thread bridging; devices pair via QR codes. Research: CSA Matter spec for implementation; compatible with Home Assistant.
