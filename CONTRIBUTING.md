# Contributing

This repository is published primarily for portfolio/showcase and user transparency.

Contributions are not the primary focus, but they are not forbidden.

If you want to contribute:
1. Open an issue first with a short proposal.
2. Keep changes focused and minimal.
3. Do not remove attribution or license text.

Please note:
1. Maintainers may not review or merge every PR.
2. There is no guaranteed response time.
